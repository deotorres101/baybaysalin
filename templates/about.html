                    <h1 class="text-center">WHAT WE ARE</h1>
                    <p class="step">Baybaysalin is a multi-dialect Baybayin image to text converter system that uses Speeded-Up Robust Features (SURF) algorithm and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The system is aimed to help users in recognizing Baybayin characters in its different forms: Tagalog, Tagbanwa, and Hanunuo. It does this by having an image with Baybayin characters as an input to the system. Individual Baybayin characters will then be recognized and separated from the images. This will then go through SURF for detecting the features of the characters and passing it through the CNN model for categorizing those characters into their respective dialect (Tagalog, Tagbanwa, Hanunuo) and equivalent Filipino letters. The researchers aim to help the people in understanding Baybayin by having an application that can be used to take a photo of a Baybayin word and then getting the Baybayin dialect and its equivalent word written in Filipino Alphabet. This gives an emphasis and importance on the Filipino culture by making it easier to understand the writing system developed by the Filipino ancestors.  The study uses a confusion matrix to determine the results for recognizing the dialect and having a correct output of words. All of the dialect models have a higher count of True Positive (TP) than the True Negative (TN), which means most of the time it correctly recognizes the dialect and outputs the correct converted word. The accuracy of the dialect detection and word conversion were both separated. For dialect detection, the Hanunuo model gets the highest accuracy of 89.87%. Next is the Tagalog model with an accuracy of 76.71%, and the Tagbanwa model with an accuracy of 76.01%. For the system conversion of the word, the Tagalog model has the highest accuracy of 51.14%. Next is the Tagbanwa model with an accuracy of 51.01% and last is the Hanunuo model with an accuracy of 48.86%.  </p>
